==========
parameters
==========
order: an integer reprsenting the order of the two functions
    - example: 2
    - restrictions: can't be negative
scalar_f: a list representing of floats reprenting the scalars of the 
          first function in order-descending order
    - example: [2.5, 1]
    - restrictions: length is equal to order
scalar_g: a list representing of floats reprenting the scalars of the 
          second function in order-descending order
    - example: [1, 3.44]
    - restrictions: length is equal to order
======
result
======
string: a string expressing the inequality with the required constants in LaTeX
        valid syntax (in a given math-scope)
====
notes
====
For both the root (5.5.4) and log (5.5.6) functions, 
just use the polynomial inside them as the input data.

5.5.5 is unsolved for now.
